<h1>Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project.</h1>
<p>I have managed the states in this assignment as follows:<p>
<ol>
  <li>Fake Data State: I have stored fake data states to simulate data, so that I can work with this data later.</li>
  <li>Total Credit State: To fetch the total credits, I've used a state. In an event handler, when clicked, it sets the total credits to that state.</li>
  <li>Credit Award Remaining State: To keep track of remaining credits to be awarded, I've utilized a state. When an event handler is clicked, it subtracts the credit from the total, and this value is stored in the state.</li>
</ol>
